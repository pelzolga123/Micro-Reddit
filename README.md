# Micro-Reddit

This is a simple app which simulates Reddit. It uses User, Post and Comments models and creates associations between them which simulate objects on a simple message board. Developed using Ruby on Rails.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```$ bundle install --without production```

Next, migrate the database:

```$ rails db:migrate```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```$ rails test```

or

```rails test:models```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to explore the application functionalities from the console:

```$ rails console```
